The data for this project can be downloaded by : 
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

I can not upload data here because github only allows 25mb data file to be uploaded and also it can be easily
downloaded from kaggle website. Also i suggest you to run these program on kaggle kernel Because it provide GPU
and is user friendly
