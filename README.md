# Pneumonia-detection-Using-Chest-X-ray-End-to-End-deployment
## [Click Here to go to Detailed explanation of code in towards data science article](https://towardsdatascience.com/pneumonia-detection-using-deep-learning-and-swagger-18aa5e8af576)
This repository describes the use of data science technique for pneumonia detection using X-Ray
The lungs_training.ipynb file describes about the use of transfer learning technique like vgg16 in training and creating model to predict the scope of pneumonia by analysing the image features.
At the end the model named vgg16.h5 is saved so it can be used of other purpose in further app deployment
Now in app.ipynb file we have used flask and flassger api to build the front end for the system and focus on the how the output will be displayed is in these link https://devarshpatel.weebly.com/pneumonia-detection.html
please visit the above file to better understand the working of the deployment.

The data for this project can be downloaded by: 
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

I cannot upload data here because GitHub only allows 25mb data file to be uploaded and also it can be easily
downloaded from Kaggle website. Also, i suggest you to run this program on Kaggle kernel Because it provides GPU
and is user friendly
